# thyncAPI
> The one and only thyncAPI. Used for thync projects

## About
This was originally created just for the thync Bot, a discord bot that syncs with thync. However, I do think this could be more handy in other sub-projects, so I created this a bit more detailed and etc. Some of the code is used from Reflux, a project and module created by frissyn and CoolCoderSJ. However, this issue and suggestion came up, so I decided to create this. thync has also become sub-projects and a major project.

> thync has not come out yet, this is just the thyncAPI.

> Also, thyncAPI does not currently work with `requests` yet. It will soon on the next release.

## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy using this API. I might have to switch some code around to make it an 'actual' API, as right now, it just shows code and stuff. See you on the next post!
